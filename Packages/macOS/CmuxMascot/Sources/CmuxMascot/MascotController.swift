/// Public entry point for the T-Rex mascot.

/// The mascot is an embedded strip (see ``MascotStripView``) rather than a
/// window: the controller just holds visibility + the animation state. The app
/// target owns a single instance (the composition root) and embeds the strip
/// above its project tabs — there is deliberately no shared singleton, so the
/// module stays free of app-global state and is easy to lift elsewhere.
///
/// Future hearts/quest behavior attaches here: a `MascotState` value plus a
/// hydration-quest loop (the same cancellable `Task`/`Clock` primitive the
/// animator uses) would hang off this controller without touching the app.
